      A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born
      October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian
      scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of
      India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India
      from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from
      the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research
      and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space
      Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the
      first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in
      India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a
      number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile
      Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
      ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was
      launched in 1989.
